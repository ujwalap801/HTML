## Tag is just the part inside the angle brackets.

 ## What are HTML tags? 
## Answer: 
## Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They surround content and apply meaning (e.g., p for paragraph, h1 for heading). 

## Element is the whole thing, including tags and content.

# Block Elements:
### Definition: Block elements are those that occupy the full width available (the entire line), and they start on a new line. They are typically used for structural layout.

### Characteristics:
### Always start on a new line.
### Can contain other block elements or inline elements.
### They can have width and height properties applied.

### Examples:
### div: A generic container for grouping elements.
### p: Represents a paragraph.
### h1, h2, etc.: Headings of different levels.
### ul, ol: Unordered and ordered lists.



## Inline Elements:
### Definition: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are typically used to format small sections of content within block elements.

### Characteristics:
### Do not force line breaks; they flow within the text.
### Cannot contain block elements but can contain other inline elements.
### Width and height properties do not apply in the same way as with block elements.

### Examples:
### span: A generic inline container for text or other inline elements.
### a: Hyperlink that can be clicked.
### strong: Represents strong importance, usually rendered as bold text.
### img: Embeds an image within the text.
### b: to make the text bold
