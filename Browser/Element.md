### Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have any content or closing tags. They are self-closing and cannot contain child elements. These elements are used for tasks like embedding media, inserting line breaks, or creating horizontal rules.


## Examples of Void Elements:
### <img> (for images)
### <input> (for form inputs)
### <br> (for line breaks)
### <hr> (for horizontal rules)
### <meta> (for metadata)
### <link> (for linking external resources like CSS files)


## Tag is just the part inside the angle brackets.
## Element is the whole thing, including tags and content.

# Block Elements:
### Definition: Block elements are those that occupy the full width available (the entire line), and they start on a new line. They are typically used for structural layout.

### Characteristics:
### Always start on a new line.
### Can contain other block elements or inline elements.
### They can have width and height properties applied.

### Examples:
### <div>: A generic container for grouping elements.
### <p>: Represents a paragraph.
### <h1>, <h2>, etc.: Headings of different levels.
### <ul>, <ol>: Unordered and ordered lists.



## Inline Elements:
### Definition: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are typically used to format small sections of content within block elements.

### Characteristics:
### Do not force line breaks; they flow within the text.
### Cannot contain block elements but can contain other inline elements.
### Width and height properties do not apply in the same way as with block elements.

### Examples:
### <span>: A generic inline container for text or other inline elements.
### <a>: Hyperlink that can be clicked.
### <strong>: Represents strong importance, usually rendered as bold text.
### <img>: Embeds an image within the text.


### In HTML, an attribute is a specification that provides additional information about an element. Attributes are defined in the opening tag of an element and typically consist of a name-value pair.




### Examples of Common Attributes:
### href: Used in anchor tags (<a>) to specify the URL of the link.
### src: Used in image tags (<img>) to define the path to the image file.
### alt: Provides alternative text for images, improving accessibility.
### class: Assigns one or more class names to an element for styling with CSS.
### id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, often used for linking and styling.



## Xml and html difference

 ### HTML is primarily concerned with the presentation and layout of web content, while XML focuses on the transport and storage of data. HTML is more user-oriented, while XML is more data-oriented and suited for machine readability.
