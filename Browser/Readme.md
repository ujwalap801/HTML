### In web technology, a browser is a software application used to access and view websites and web content on the internet. Browsers interpret and render HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, which are the core technologies behind most web pages. They allow users to navigate the web, interact with multimedia, fill out forms, and more.

### Common examples of web browsers include:

### Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge Safari



## Website:

### A website is a collection of related web pages that are grouped under a single domain name. Websites are often informational and can be static or dynamic.

### Example: A blog, a company's informational site, or a news portal like BBC.com.
### Key feature: Primarily focuses on displaying content to users (text, images, videos).


## Web Application:

### A web application is an interactive software system accessed via a web browser. Unlike websites, web applications often involve user input and data processing.

### Example: Gmail, Facebook, or Google Docs.

### Key feature: Functionality is more interactive and complex, often resembling a desktop application but running in the browser. Users can perform tasks, enter data, and interact with the system.


## Web Page:

### A web page is a single document on the internet, typically written in HTML, and can be part of a website. It is what you see when you visit a particular URL within a website.

### Example: A product page on an e-commerce site, a blog post, or a contact page.
### Key feature: A web page can be static or dynamic, but it represents a single part of a larger website.

## A website is the overall entity or collection of web pages.
## A web page is one document or part of a website.
## A web application is more interactive, functioning like software where users perform tasks, rather than just reading content.
