### Images are void elements, Img element is inline element (Occupies the required length)


### <video> and <audio> are normal HTML5 elements used to embed media content directly into web pages.

### So, <video> and <audio>:
### Are technically inline elements, like <img>.
### But behave like inline-block
### But because they render media players with size, they behave like inline-block:
### Can sit next to other elements (inline)
### Can be sized using width and height
### Don't force a full-width layout
