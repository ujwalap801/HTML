### In HTML, an attribute is a specification that provides additional information about an element. Attributes are defined in the opening tag of an element and typically consist of a name-value pair.


### Examples of Common Attributes:
### href: Used in anchor tags (a) to specify the URL of the link.
### src: Used in image tags (img) to define the path to the image file.
### alt: Provides alternative text for images, improving accessibility.
### class: Assigns one or more class names to an element for styling with CSS.
### id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, often used for linking and styling.
