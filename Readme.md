# HTML Overview

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using elements (or tags) to define different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML works in conjunction with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for dynamic behavior) to create interactive and visually appealing websites.

## Markup Language vs Programming Language

A **markup language** (e.g., HTML) is used to structure and format content using tags, but it doesn't perform logic or computation. In contrast, a **programming language** (e.g., Python, Java) is used to write instructions for a computer to perform tasks, manipulate data, and execute logic.

## The `<!DOCTYPE html>` Declaration

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used in HTML to define the document type and version of HTML being used. It tells the web browser to render the page using **standard mode** (as per HTML5 specifications), ensuring consistent interpretation of the page across different browsers. This declaration must be placed at the very beginning of an HTML document.
