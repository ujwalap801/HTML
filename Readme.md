# HTML Overview

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using elements (or tags) to define different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML works in conjunction with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for dynamic behavior) to create interactive and visually appealing websites.

## Markup Language vs Programming Language

### A markup language is used to define the structure and presentation of content, mainly in text documents. For example, HTML is a markup language that structures web pages using tags like `<div>` or `<p>.` It doesn't include logic like conditions or loops.

### In contrast, a programming language like Python or Java is used to write instructions that a computer can execute. It supports logic, loops, functions, and variables to perform tasks, process data, and solve problems.

### So, the key difference is that markup languages describe what the data is, while programming languages describe what to do with the data

## The `<!DOCTYPE html>` Declaration

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used in HTML to define the document type and version of HTML being used. It tells the web browser to render the page using **standard mode** (as per HTML5 specifications), ensuring consistent interpretation of the page across different browsers. This declaration must be placed at the very beginning of an HTML document.


## Xml and html difference

 ### HTML is primarily concerned with the presentation and layout of web content, while XML focuses on the transport and storage of data. HTML is more user-oriented, while XML is more data-oriented and suited for machine readability.


### XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed to store, transport, and structure data in a human-readable and machine-readable format. Unlike HTML, which has a fixed set of tags, XML is extensible, meaning you define your own tags based on the data you're working with.

### "HTML and XML are both markup languages, but they serve very different purposes. HTML is designed to display data and create the structure of web pages. It uses predefined tags like div, p, and a to tell the browser how to present content.

### XML, on the other hand, is designed to store and transport data. It doesn't have predefined tags — instead, developers define their own tags to describe the data, like user, order, etc.

### One key difference is that XML is very strict with syntax — every tag must be closed and properly nested, and it's case-sensitive. HTML is more lenient; browsers can handle minor errors. So, in short: HTML is for displaying information, while XML is for describing and exchanging structured data."
